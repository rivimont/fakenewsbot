### Creating a fake news bot at DevNet Create
This repository is for the purpose of the "Leveraging Cisco Umbrella Security APIs to Build Your Own Fake News Bot" workshop at the first [DevNet Create](https://devnetcreate.io/2017/) developer conference in SF.

### Motivations
* Cisco Umbrella Hackathon 2017 - This was an internal event where a team created a Chrome Extension that would scan the current site you were on and generate a score listing the chance it through the site you were on was fake news. It made use of Natural Language Process (NLP) algorithms and was enriched with security intelligence from the Umbrella Investigate DB. 
* [CiscoPipeline.io](http://www.ciscopipeline.io) - This was a project (created by [@vallard](http://www.twitter.com/vallard)) that came out of a [Cisco Innovate Everywhere Challenge](https://newsroom.cisco.com/documents/10157/14740/790057-WhitePaper-060816-FINAL.pdf). It is essentially a cutting edge cloud application development platform that anyone can consume built on some pretty cool technology (Kubernetes, OpenStack, and of course Cisco hardware)
* [Cisco Metacloud](http://www.cisco.com/go/metacloud) - This is Cisco's managed OpenStack offering with a guaranteed 99.99% uptime. This is the underlying platform running the majority of elements in this stack.
* [Kubernetes](http://www.kubernetes.io) - Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This is one of the behind-the-scenes pieces of technology running in this environment on top of OpenStack. It's been absolutely amazing to be a part of this community the last year. I was even fortunate enough to participate in helping teach a few Kubernetes classes, which can be found at [https://github.com/CiscoCloud/k8sclass](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/k8sclass)

I thought it would be a great idea to bring some of this awesome technology together in a way people could easily assume. The first DevNet Create event also seemed like an ideal venue!
